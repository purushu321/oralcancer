This project focuses on the development of a deep learning model for the automated detection of oral cancer. Leveraging the power of the VGG16 architecture and a carefully curated dataset of oral images, the model demonstrates impressive accuracy in distinguishing between 'Normal' and 'OSCC' cases. With a training accuracy of 94% and a validation accuracy of 85% and the overall acuuracy 90%, the model showcases its proficiency in learning relevant features. The project also includes a comprehensive testing procedure, utilizing techniques like data augmentation and model evaluation metrics. Future enhancements could involve incorporating more diverse datasets, exploring advanced architectures, and deploying the model for real-time applications in clinical settings.
